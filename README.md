##üîπ 1. Generating Monthly Reports

Example: Fetch revenue per day for a given month

sales = { "2025-02-01" => 1000, "2025-02-02" => 2000, "2025-02-10" => 500 } # Sample sales data

month.days.each do |day|
  puts "#{day}: $#{sales[day.to_s] || 0}"
end
```

####üìå Output:
```
2025-02-01: $1000  
2025-02-02: $2000  
2025-02-03: $0  
...
2025-02-10: $500  
```

## üîπ 2. Calendar & Scheduling Systems

Generate a calendar for scheduling shifts, meetings, or events

```
month = Month.new(Date.today)
puts "üìÖ Calendar for #{month.name}"
month.weeks.each { |week| puts week.to_s }
```

####üìå Output:
```
Week 5, 2025
Week 6, 2025
Week 7, 2025
Week 8, 2025
Week 9, 2025
...
```

## üîπ 3. Recurring Events & Subscriptions

Automate billing cycles, gym memberships, or SaaS renewals

```
def next_billing_cycle(start_date)
  Month.new(start_date).next.start_date
end

puts next_billing_cycle(Date.today) # => 2025-03-01
```

‚û°Ô∏è Use this for subscription renewals, invoice due dates, etc.

## üîπ 4. Employee Shift Management

Organize employees' shifts week-by-week in a month

```
month = Month.new(2025, 2)
shifts = {
  "2025-02-05" => "John",
  "2025-02-10" => "Anna"
}

month.each_day do |day|
  puts "#{day}: #{shifts[day.to_s] || 'No Shift'}"
end
```

‚û°Ô∏è Helps in HR systems for workforce planning.


## üîπ 5. Generating Reports for a Quarter
